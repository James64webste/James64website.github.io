        <p>There will only be three episodes next week since I'll be away and don't have time to get 5 ready. I've also switched to recording my microphone separately from the game audio. It's a bit of a hassle but it pays off in terms of having more options while editing. Also, it seems like obs noise reduction was making my voice sound off sometimes. </p>

           <p>Well, I finally made a new video, and it wasn't what I said I was gonna make.<br><br>  Admittedly, I did record and begin editing a new alpha adventure episode, but I just wasn't having fun with it and you can tell while watching. I have come to the realization that I think I should take a break from Minecraft alpha 1.1.x . It's by far the version I have played the most. It's been my version of choice since around 2014 and it's definitely starting to get a little stale.<br><br> Anyways, check out the new Aether series if you haven't already, more episodes are on the way!</p>

        <p>I'm currently working multiple big and small projects such as more episodes of Alpha adventure, edited Decennium videos and video quality test 4, as well as some other videos that I'm not ready to share yet. I am also planning to get back to streaming regularly, at least once a week.</p>
